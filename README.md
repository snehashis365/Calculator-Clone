# Calculator (Clone)
### This Calculator App is basically a clone in general sense I wrote this from scartch whilst learning Kotlin as a way of practicing

### I used the [ExprK Library](https://github.com/Keelar/ExprK) for evaluating the expressions it's still a work in progress but an alpha version will be released shortly
